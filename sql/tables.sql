-- this script creates 3 tables in the current database, which roughly correspond to the tables given in the coursework outline

-- refer to https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/create-table.html#create-table-options for
-- more details, but broadly speaking: MyISAM is the "almost always read" table setting, and
-- has been used as the engine for this reason

-- NOTE:
-- 1. all tables have `id` as their first field and primary key
-- 2. arbitrary text fields are either short (varchar(20)), long (varchar(40)), or unbounded (longtext)
-- 3. foreign keys are explicitly defined with the foreign key directive
-- 4. where possible (e.g. in users.rating) types are strictly constrained
